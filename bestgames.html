<h1>The hibees best wins</h1>

<p> Hecky’s at the wheel for Hibs.
And at Tynecastle today, his team motored past city rivals Hearts in the Scottish Premiership with a priceless derby win.

It's no wonder the Hibees' fans have a new song for gaffer Paul Heckingbottom and chanted it throughout the 90 minutes.
Since replacing Neil Lennon in the Easter Road hotseat, his side are still unbeaten in the league, taking 20 points from 24.
And after being a goal down in his first Edinburgh battle, Heckingbottom's men showed terrific character here to take all three. </p>

<h1>Hibs win at ibrox 2-3!</h1>

<p>Hibernian continued their strong start to the season with a win at Ibrox against 10-man Rangers.
Alfredo Morelos headed the hosts in front after three minutes, with Simon Murray levelling with a neat finish.
James Tavernier deflected in a Vykintas Slivka shot to give Hibs a half-time lead soon after Ryan Jack's red card.
Slivka cracked in a lovely strike to stretch the visitors' advantage, while Rangers could not add to a late header from Tavernier.
Promoted Hibs remain unbeaten this term, into the last eight of the League Cup and at the top end of the Premiership, along with three other sides with two victories</p>

<p>Tavernier's late consolation means Hibs have won the past three meetings between the sides by the same scoreline at different venues.
The previous game was the Edinburgh club's Scottish Cup triumph in 2016.
With only three survivors from that dramatic Hampden final in the Rangers line-up, it was the hosts who started a fiery match at a whirlwind pace, taking a very early lead.
A Daniel Candeias free-kick found Morelos and the Colombian striker nodded in from close range, following his midweek cup double against Dunfermline.
With Hibs looking jittery, Kenny Miller gathered a poor clearance from goalkeeper Ofir Marciano and chipped narrowly wide.
Miller then had a shot deflected onto the post after a good run and cutback from Josh Windass.Hibs equalised with their first attempt on goal, as Murray cut in from the left and skipped past Fabio Cardoso to steer in his 10th goal of the season.
The noisy Ibrox crowd was stunned and there was further anguish for the home fans when Jack was sent off for angrily grabbing Dylan McGeouch before a heated exchange with Anthony Stokes right in front of referee John Beaton following one of the game's many meaty challenges.
The visitors took full advantage when Murray advanced from the right and picked out Slivka on the edge of the six yard box with a low pass.
The Lithuanian international, signed from Juventus in the summer, took a touch before firing in an angled shot that appeared to be going wide before Tavernier inadvertently turned the ball into his own net.
Hibs pressed for another before the interval and Wes Foderingham had to look lively to save a drilled effort from John McGinn.
Rangers boss Pedro Caixinha made two half-time changes, going with three centre-halves and pushing his full-backs forward, with Hibs continuing to look a threat on the break.
There was a stirring from the home side as a Morelos shot was deflected wide after Cardoso wasted a free header from a corner.</p>


<h1>Hibs beat the champions 2-1 at easter road </h1>

Celtic missed the chance to seal the Premiership title after defeat by a high-tempo, assertive Hibernian side.
They went into the game needing to win to secure their seventh consecutive title, but will have to wait to be confirmed champions.
Jamie Maclaren opened the scoring for Hibs in the first half and Vykintas Slivka headed in after the break.
Kristoffer Ajer cleared off Celtic's goal-line before Odsonne Edouard scored a late consolation.

The victory was Hibs' first over Celtic since December 2012, and the third time that Brendan Rodgers' side have lost in the league this season.
The visitors were overwhelmed at Easter Road, as the Hibs players swarmed all over the pitch to take command.
Everything before the game screamed "party", but from the second the match got under way it was clear Hibs had very different ideas.
Neil Lennon's side were everything that Rangers failed to be against the champions at Hampden in the Scottish Cup semi-final last weekend. They were full of fight. They were full of belief and they took the game to their visitors in a thoroughly entertaining game in the Leith sunshine. 
Celtic by no means had an off day. Tom Rogic and Leigh Griffiths both had early efforts but Ofir Marciano in the Hibs goal, like the rest of his team-mates, looked very much in the mood and denied them.
Once again, the Hibs midfield was critical to all that was good about the home side. Central to that, like so often this season, was John McGinn.

<h1>Hibs win 5-3 over Steve clarks kilmarnock!</h1>



Hibs boosted their chances of securing second spot in the Premiership with a thrilling victory over Kilmarnock.
Scott Allan scored the hosts' opener but Kris Boyd replied before Steven Whittaker's restored Hibs' lead.
Stuart Findlay squared it before goals from Jamie Maclaren and Florian Kamberi made it 4-2.
Boyd's stunning free-kick reduced the deficit but Brandon Barker's solo goal sealed the win and ensured Hibs join third-placed Rangers on 65 points

Hibs are now only 3 pionts behind Aberdeen in second and hibs are rolling after there emphatic win over Celtic. The home side enjoyed early an possession game but steve clark side stepped 
up the tempo and seemed to struggle but hibs huffed and puffed to win the game back and it finished 5-3 with Brandon barker scoring late on to seal the win. which ended 5-3 for the Edinburgh side and are sitting 4th in the league. And still to play rangers

<h1>Hibs get a late winner against rangers as it finishes 5-5!!</h1>

Rangers finished third in the Scottish Premiership after an incredible draw at Hibernian that featured 10 goals, a red card and an injury-time equaliser that completed a hat-trick.
The Gers had stormed back from 3-0 down at Easter Road to level at half-time - then led 5-3 in the second half.
But Jamie Maclaren's late equaliser snatched a dramatic point for Hibs.
Aberdeen's victory over Celtic meant the Gers could not have overtaken them to take second even if they had won.
Even that outcome looked unlikely when the Ibrox side went three goals down inside 22 minutes as Hibs struck through Florian Kamberi - from the penalty spot - Scott Allan and Maclaren.
Back roared the Gers, with James Tavernier, Jordan Rossiter and Bruno Alves - with a stunning free-kick - scoring.

The Edinburgh side needed to win by 6 goals to go 3rd in the Scottish premiership table they went 3-0 up goals from Kamberi,allan and maclaren the hibs fans thought they could have 
done it befoe james tavernier gets a goal to give rangers a chance then it went 3-3 as hibs looked to have lost their stride 
when bruno fernandes and jason holt then windass managed to get on the score sheet it looked no way back for hibs until jamie maclaren finished his hatrick
and it was sunshine on lieth for hibs.

<h1>Hibs beat hearts 2-0 at easter road </h1>

The electric atmosphere inside ester Road was not matched by the football in the first 25 minutes but soon enough 
scott allan drilled a low driven arrowed shot into the bottom right hand corner.It was fast and frenetic, with tackles flying in across the pitch, but there was little in the way of style or clear-cut chances
The winger showed fantastic tenacity and grit with a 40-yard run that began just inside his own half, and although his shot was on target, Hearts keeper McLaughlin was able to save with ease.
The one scare for the home side in the opening period came when centre-half Darren McGregor and goalkeeper Ofir Marciano got in a bit of a tangle as a cross came in, but they were quick to recover.
Jamie maclaren was able to celebrate his Australia call up with a goal after a long throw into the box were he was able to shield the ball from the hearts and scottish international center half john souttar 
and fired a shot into the same corner as Allan's earlier effort and edinnburgh was green and white after Bobby Madden blew the whistle for the last time.
